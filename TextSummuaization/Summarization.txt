'Papa, What is a Neural Network?At the back of my head, thoughts of me taking days to comprehend what a NN (short for Neural Network) is, how it would work, where it is used, how it is simulating our human brain’s inner workings were going through. “Neural Network is a collection (a network) of neurons whose job is to learn a new thing or a new place or a new process or a new concept.” After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before. When you see a new object, your brain will ask the neurons, ‘Hey, anybody experienced this before?’ The neurons will say, ‘Yes, I have seen this.’ Certain other neurons will say, ‘No, I have not seen this.’ The neurons that have seen this before, will group together and form logical connections from the past and gives us an object from our memory. The same principle is applied for a song that you hear, a cartoon that you watch, a rhyme that you sing, an animal that you draw, a food that you taste, a flower that you smell and so on.'

'After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before. Was it a dog or a lion? Do you know what is the difference between a lion and a dog?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “This is called Learning. Picture of my version of Neural Network with their Neuron friends“Your brain is here inside our head. Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog.'

'Papa, What is a Neural Network?At the back of my head, thoughts of me taking days to comprehend what a NN (short for Neural Network) is, how it would work, where it is used, how it is simulating our human brain’s inner workings were going through. How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home. Every neuron is waiting for your eyes to see something new, for your nose to smell something new, for your ears to hear something new, for your tongue to taste something new. When something new is heard, or smelled, or seen, or tasted, the neurons will group together to send signals and forms connections with already seen, heard, tasted or smelled neurons. When you see a new object, your brain will ask the neurons, ‘Hey, anybody experienced this before?’ The neurons will say, ‘Yes, I have seen this.’ Certain other neurons will say, ‘No, I have not seen this.’ The neurons that have seen this before, will group together and form logical connections from the past and gives us an object from our memory.'

'If you’ve noticed, this is how ML people make their machines learn through Reinforcement Learning. For example, when I showed you a lion picture, your brain asked the neurons who had seen it before. Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on. And I hope she will not come to me running asking “Papa, what is Meural Metark?” again. And I have a strong feeling; she would ask me another stunning question sooner or later.'

Best method for the task: Gensim Sumarizatrion

Reason: As we can see in notebook, Gensim score has highest BLEU score and second heighest ROUGE score, which means it is the best summarization from other candidates.
